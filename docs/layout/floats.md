# Floats

Single purpose classes for setting the display of an element at any breakpoint.

Floats may be set on any element, but it will only affect elements that arenâ€™t
absolutely positioned. When you float an element you inherently set its display to block.

There are only three values that can be declared for float: `left`, `right`, or `none`.
These three base classes are very easy to memorize: `v-fl`, `v-fr`, `v-fn`.
Combine float left/right with width utilities to create fluid multi-column layouts.

## Examples

### Float Left

```vue
<p v-fl>Float Left</p>
```

<FloatLeft />

### Float Right

```vue
<p v-fr>Float Right</p>
```

<FloatRight />

### Float None

```vue
<p v-fn>Float None</p>
```

<FloatNone />

### Float With Images

Originally floats were used to wrap text around images as in the example below.

```vue
<div v-cf>
  <img v-fl :alt="altText" :src="imgSrc" />
  <p v-measure>
    {{ loremIpsum }}
  </p>
</div>
```

<ImageExample />
